I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Central European Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Institute_of_Technology/). Previously, I was affiliated with [University of Southern Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_Denmark), where I worked on medical image analysis projects; with [Spanish National Research Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_National_Research_Council), where I participated on the development of the cryo-em image processing framework called [Scipion](http://scipion.i2pc.es/), and with [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_University_of_Science_and_Technology), where I focused on automated melanoma recognition techniques.<br />
<br /> 
I received my Ph.D. degree in image processing from [Masaryk University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaryk_University) in 2015. My current research focus is on (bio)medical image processing and machine learning. I have online research profiles at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KcUL5tsAAAAJ), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tomas-Majtner), [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55547213000), [Web of Science/Publons](https://publons.com/researcher/1945502/tomas-majtner/), and [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5279-8806).<br />
My [ha-index](https://www.irif.fr/~haberm//haindex.html) is 93 and my Erd≈ës number is 4 (based on [CSAuthors](https://www.csauthors.net/distance/tomas-majtner/paul-erdos)).
